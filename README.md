# HIVmixedEffectsClock

This repo provides the analysis input files associated with a manuscript on dating the origin of HIV-1 group M using a mixed effects clock model.

The xml file contains the HIV-1 group M data, the mixed effects models settings, the prior specifications and the analysis settings. The xml can be run using the hmc-clock branch of BEAST (https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc).
